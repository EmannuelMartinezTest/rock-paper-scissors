# A Text-Based Game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors!"
(12/26/23)
The first iteration is just going to be the text-based game, which will be
placed on its own separate folder. Afterwards, I'm hoping to implement 
a version of the game with a GUI, which will be the main one published
on the eventual github.io page.
